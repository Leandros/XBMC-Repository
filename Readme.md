Leandros' Repository for XBMC Stuff
===================================

This is my repository for all XBMC related stuff. It's just the repository for the repository, which isn't hosted on Github.

**Currently containing:**

- repository.leandros.xbmc-plugins: The Repository addon itself.
- script.module.requests2: The popular Python library 'Requests' by kennethreitz.
- plugin.programs.steambmcdev: The SteamBMC addon, which is currently in development.


**Structure:**

The `repo` folder is the repository itself, it's a mirror of the actual repository.
In the root folder is the source for the repository addon itself and the requests addon.
